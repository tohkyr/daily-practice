# Day 4

**Day 4:** Code a program that asks the user for a number n and prints the sum of 1 to n. The program will ask the user to re-enter the input if the input is not an integer.

**What I learned:** Strengthened knowledge about while loops, try, sum, except, else, continue, break and problems solving skills.
