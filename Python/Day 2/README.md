# Day 2
Took a break from programming for a bit to focus on Art and Music (and a bit of laziness too :P)  
From now on I'll try my best to post regularly so prepare for really simple programs (like this)  
**Day 2:** Code a program that ask for your name and return a greeting.

**What I've learned:** Learned how to use Input, adding strings and variable together in a print function.
