# Day 5

**Day 5:** Code a program that asks the user for a number n and prints number 1 to n that is divisible by 3 and 5. The program will ask the user to re-enter the input if the input is not an integer.

**What I learned:** Strengthened knowledge about while loops, try, modulo, except, else, continue, break and problems solving skills.
