# Day 6

**Day 6:** Code a  random number guessing game from 1-20 and print the number of attempts that the player took (Max 10 attempts). The program will say Go Lower or Higher depending on the player input.

**What I learned:** Strengthened knowledge about while loops, try, exit, learning how to restart the code and strengthened problems solving skills.
