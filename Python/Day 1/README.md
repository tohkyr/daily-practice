# Day 1
This is day 1 of my coding practice.

**Day 1:** Code a program in python that compares if a is >, < or = to b and give results.  
Program 1 is the first version of the code, which is quite messy with no options for user to re-input their data.  
Program 2 is an improved version utilizing While loop for user re-input and try, except for instant input error checks and def functions for ease of use.  

**What I learned:** While, try, except, ValueError, continue, break. How to use a loop and how to use def and functions.
